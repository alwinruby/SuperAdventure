# Super Adventure

This is my first attempt at making a simple Role Playing Game  built in C#.

## Getting Started
 
Clone the Repository to your machine and navigate to the folder where the directory is cloned.  

### Pre requisites

On windows machines no ensure that all updates are installed.  For Mac and Linux can use wine HQ to launch the application.

Navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned and to the Game folder.  There select and click on SuperAdventure.exe

### To Play

To start click on the North Button.  Look at the current state of the situation and choose your direction.

At present the game is basic and you can play with the direction buttons and the use buttons.

### Future

Please note that this is the first release of the game by me I will be adding to, and improving this game in the future.
