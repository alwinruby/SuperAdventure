# Enhancements

### Ideas for new futures


    * Save the player’s current game to disk, and re-load it later
    * As the player gains experience, increase their level
    * Increase MaximumHitPoints with each new level
    * Add a minimum level requirement for some items
    * Add a minimum level requirement for some locations
    * Add randomization to battles
    * Determine if the player hits the monster
    * Determine if the monster hits the player
    * Add player attributes (strength, dexterity, etc.)
    * Use attributes in battle: who attacks first, amount of damage, etc.
    * Add armor and jewelry
    * Makes it more difficult for the monster to hit the player
    * Has special benefits: increased chance to hit, increased damage, etc.
    * Add crafting skills the player can acquire
    * Add crafting recipes the player use
    * Require the appropriate skill
    * Requires components (inventory items)
    * Make some quests repeatable
    * Make quest chains (player must complete “Quest A” before they can receive “Quest B”)
    * Add magic scrolls
    * Add spells
    * Level requirements for the spells
    * Spells require components to cast (maybe?)
    * Add more potions
    * More powerful healing potions
    * Potions to improve player’s “to hit” chances, or damage
    * Add poisons to use in battle
    * Add pets
    * Help the player in battle by attacking opponents
    * Help the player in battle by healing the player
    * Add stores/vendors
    * Player can sell useless items and buy new equipment, scrolls, potions, poisons, and crafting/spell components


### Programming techniques to make the program a little cleaner

    * LINQ, when searching lists
    * Events/delegates, to handle communication between the “logic” project and the UI project – which will let you move more logic code out of the UI project
    * BindingList, so you don’t have to repeatedly repopulate the DataGridViews and ComboBox in the UI
